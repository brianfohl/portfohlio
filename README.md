# Portfohlio

Welcome to my Portfohlio (a play on my last name, Fohl) - a showcase of my professional experience and technical capabilities. This project serves both as my online resume and a demonstration of modern web development and DevOps practices.

## 🌟 Features

- Next.js-powered portfolio website
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Docker containerization
- Comprehensive unit testing
- Static code analysis with SonarQube
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- GitHub Pages deployment

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: 
  - ESLint for code linting
  - SonarQube for static code analysis
- **DevOps**:
  - Docker for containerization
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - GitHub Pages for hosting

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 📝 Development Practices

This project demonstrates several modern development practices:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Comprehensive unit tests with good coverage
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and code analysis on every push
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Container Strategy**: Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized production images
- **Code Quality**: Automated code quality checks with SonarQube

## 🌐 Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages through GitHub Actions. The deployment pipeline includes:

1. Code quality checks
2. Unit testing
3. Static code analysis
4. Build and deployment
